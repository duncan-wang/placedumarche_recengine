The original purpose of The Yellow Door (at the time, YMCA of McGill), incorporated by a motion of Parliament in 1904, was to promote morality, religion, and social intercourse at the university. Later on, as the organization became more independent and the focus strayed from Christian values, our name was changed to The Yellow Door and the whole of the downtown core became our workplace.
